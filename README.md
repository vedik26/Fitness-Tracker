BMI Calculator – Java Swing Application

This is a desktop-based BMI Calculator application developed using Java Swing for the user interface and MySQL for database management.

The application allows users to input their height and weight to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI). Based on the calculated value, the system classifies the user's health status into categories such as Underweight, Normal Weight, Overweight, and Obesity.

User authentication features like registration and login are included to manage individual user records securely. The application stores BMI results in a MySQL database, enabling users to view previous BMI history.

Additional functionalities include:

Viewing previously saved BMI records

Booking doctor appointments

Generating basic diet recommendations
